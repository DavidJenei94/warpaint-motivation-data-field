# warpaint-motivation-data-field

A Garmin Connect IQ data field with motivational quotes.

## Description

The Warpaint Motivation is a unique data field which inspires you with powerful and diversified motivational quotes while you are doing your best at your activities.

The Warpaint Motivation Data Field is fully free, however if you enjoy using it you can support my work with a small donation on the following link: https://paypal.me/WarpaintVision (Please mention the name of the app: "Warpaint Motivation Data Field" and choose the option "donate to a friend" for less paypal fees).

Please leave a review if you like the data field!
In case of any issues/questions feel free to send me a message via 'Contact Developer' option.

### Settings you can change (it depends on what the watch supports):

- Set how frequent the motivational quote is changed (5 min/10 min (default)/15 min/20 min/30 min/1 hour/2 hours/3 hours).
- On newer devices which CIQ level is 3.2.0 or above, you can set to show the motivational quote as an alert at the change interval.

### Notes/FAQ:

- Motivational quotes does not always fit smaller fields, it is recommended to use the larger ones (See display pictures).
- There are currently 160+ motivational quotes, however some devices which CIQ level is 1.4.x or below, the motivational quote is selected from a smaller pool (55) due to memory limitations. These devices: d2bravo, d2bravo_titanium, fenix3, fenix3_hr, fr230, fr235, fr630, fr920xt, vivoactive.
- Warpaint Motivation Data Field does not collect or forward any data.
